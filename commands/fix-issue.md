# Enhanced Issue Fix Orchestrator

You orchestrate issue resolution by classifying issues, confirming with user, and delegating to specialized agents.

Issue to process: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Issue Analysis and Classification

### 1. Load Issue Details
- Search for issue markdown files in `./issues/` directory
- If $ARGUMENTS contains issue name, filter for specific issue
- Read issue content and any associated images

### 2. Classify Issue Type
Analyze the issue to determine its category:

**FE-FE (Frontend Only)**:
- Keywords: display, visual, skeleton, layout, CSS, style, UI, rendering
- Screenshots showing visual problems
- No API/backend errors mentioned

**FE-BE (Frontend-Backend Integration)**:
- Keywords: data, fetch, API response, loading, undefined, null data
- Network errors or data binding issues
- Frontend errors related to backend data

**BE-BE (Backend Only)**:
- Keywords: API, endpoint, database, query, field names, server error
- HTTP error codes (500, 404, etc.)
- No frontend components mentioned

### 3. User Confirmation (ALWAYS unless --type specified)

Check if `--type` parameter provided in $ARGUMENTS:
- If YES: Skip confirmation, use specified type
- If NO: ALWAYS ask for confirmation

Present classification to user:
```
Issue Classification Analysis:
- Detected indicators: [list key findings]
- Suggested type: [fe-fe|fe-be|be-be]
- Confidence: [percentage]

Please confirm issue type (y/[fe-fe|fe-be|be-be]):
```

Wait for user response before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Initialize Tracking

Use TodoWrite to create execution plan:
```
1. [ ] Analyze issue: [name]
2. [ ] Classify as: [type]
3. [ ] Iteration 1: Implement fix
4. [ ] Iteration 1: Validate fix
5. [ ] [Additional iterations as needed]
6. [ ] Report final status
```

## Phase 3: Agent Delegation

### For FE-FE Issues:
Launch frontend-issue-fixer agent:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Fix frontend issue"
  subagent_type: "frontend-issue-fixer"
  prompt: |
    Fix the frontend issue: $ARGUMENTS
    Issue type: FE-FE

    Use Playwright MCP tools to:
    1. Navigate to affected page
    2. Reproduce the visual issue
    3. Identify and fix the problem
    4. Validate the fix

    Write report to: ./analyzer-output/[issue]-report-[iteration].md
    Return the report path.
```

### For BE-BE Issues:
Launch backend-issue-fixer agent:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Fix backend issue"
  subagent_type: "backend-issue-fixer"
  prompt: |
    Fix the backend issue: $ARGUMENTS
    Issue type: BE-BE

    1. Run tests to reproduce issue
    2. If no test covers it, create new test
    3. Fix the backend logic/API
    4. Validate all tests pass

    Write report to: ./analyzer-output/[issue]-report-[iteration].md
    Return the report path.
```

### For FE-BE Issues:
Sequential execution:

1. First, launch frontend agent to identify data issues:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Analyze frontend data issue"
  subagent_type: "frontend-issue-fixer"
  prompt: |
    Analyze frontend-backend issue: $ARGUMENTS
    Focus on identifying what data is wrong/missing.
    Document API calls and expected vs actual data.

    Write findings to: ./analyzer-output/[issue]-frontend-analysis.md
```

2. Then, launch backend agent with frontend findings:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Fix backend based on frontend findings"
  subagent_type: "backend-issue-fixer"
  prompt: |
    Fix backend issue identified by frontend analysis.
    Read: ./analyzer-output/[issue]-frontend-analysis.md

    Fix data structure/API response issues.
    Write report to: ./analyzer-output/[issue]-backend-fix.md
```

3. Finally, re-validate with frontend agent:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Validate frontend after backend fix"
  subagent_type: "frontend-issue-fixer"
  prompt: |
    Validate the frontend now works after backend fix.
    Test the original issue scenario.

    Write final report to: ./analyzer-output/[issue]-report-final.md
```

## Phase 4: Iterative Fix Loop

For each iteration (max 5):

### 1. Read Agent Report
```bash
cat ./analyzer-output/[issue]-report-[iteration].md
```

Extract:
- Failed count from "Failed: [Z]"
- Failed steps details
- Next actions suggested

### 2. Evaluate Progress

**If Failed: 0**
- ✅ Issue resolved!
- Mark todos completed
- Generate success summary

**If Failed > 0 but decreasing**
- Continue to next iteration
- Update todos with remaining fixes

**If no improvement for 2 iterations**
- ⚠️ Request manual intervention
- Document persistent failures
- Exit with detailed report

### 3. Next Iteration
If continuing, launch agent again with:
- Previous report path
- Specific failed steps to address
- Iteration number

## Phase 5: Final Report

Create final summary:
```
FIX ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE
========================
Issue: [name]
Type: [fe-fe|fe-be|be-be]
Iterations: [count]
Status: [RESOLVED|PARTIAL|BLOCKED]

Resolution:
- Root cause: [description]
- Fix applied: [summary]
- Files modified: [list]

Validation:
- Tests passing: [yes/no]
- Reports: ./analyzer-output/

Recommendations:
[Any follow-up actions needed]
```

## Configuration

Default settings (can be overridden):
- Max iterations: 5
- Report directory: ./analyzer-output/
- Issues directory: ./issues/

## Error Handling

If agent fails or times out:
- Check agent logs for errors
- Attempt recovery with simpler approach
- Document failure and request manual help

Always maintain clear communication with user about progress and any blockers.
